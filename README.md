# SatNOGS Rotator

Hardware for SatNOGS Rotator. This repository includes all needed source files for 3D printed (and other) parts of SatNOGS Rotator.

## Documentation

More information can be found in our [documentation](http://satnogs.org/documentation/hardware/), or our [wiki](https://wiki.satnogs.org).

## Repository policy
SatNOGS hardware repositories only track source design files. All needed derivative files (e.g. stl, grb etc) for production are created per release, packaged in an archive and uploaded linked to a  [release](https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/satnogs/satnogs-rotator/tags).

Each major release (x.0.0) is branched out of master. Subsequent fixes (minor or not) are commited on those branches and tagged accordingly.

Master branch is most times under active development, so expect things to break. For production ready and previous releases source files check tags and branches.

## Contribute

The main repository lives on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/satnogs/satnogs-rotator) and all Merge Request should happen there.
